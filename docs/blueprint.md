## Core Features:

- Voice Command Processing: Process voice commands for inventory management tasks using speech recognition and natural language processing. Uses the LLM as a tool to understand commands like 'add 10 units of milk' or 'check the quantity of eggs'.
- Stock Level Updates: Enable users to update stock levels by voice command, automatically adjusting inventory quantities in the database.
- Availability Checks: Provide real-time inventory availability information in response to voice queries, such as 'How many apples do we have?'
- Reorder Alerts: Set automated reorder alerts based on predefined thresholds, triggered by voice command to notify when stock levels are low. Send the low stock information to the LLM, using it as a tool to decide whether to trigger an alert or not.
- Report Generation: Generate inventory reports (e.g., daily sales, stock valuation) via voice command, outputting data into structured formats. For example the most demanded product can be provided as output
- Inventory Lookup: Look up specific items using a search function that responds to a voice command and reads back items from the data base to confirm them
- Item Add/Edit: Allow voice control of new product setup including parameters like price, re-order number, etc. This can include a camera capture step
