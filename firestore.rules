/**
 * @fileOverview This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for the VerbalStock application.
 * All data is nested under /users/{userId}, ensuring that only the authenticated user can access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information. The userId must match the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /users/{userId}/inventoryItems/{inventoryItemId}: Stores inventory items owned by the user.
 * - /users/{userId}/reports/{reportId}: Stores reports generated by the user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, read, update, and delete their own profiles and associated data (inventory items and reports).
 * - User listing is not allowed to protect user privacy.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The 'userId' is present in both the document path and as a field within the InventoryItem and Report documents.
 * This redundancy simplifies access control rules and avoids the need for costly 'get()' operations.
